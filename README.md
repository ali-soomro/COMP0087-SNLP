# COMP0087-SNLP


This project evaluates different Language Model-based approaches for sentiment analysis. The goal is to explore how Language Models (LMs) pre-trained on generic text data can be effectively applied to sentiment analysis tasks across various domains. The project also investigates the robustness of these models to variations in sentiment expression.

## Research Questions

### 1. Transfer Learning
- **How effectively do Language Model architectures pre-trained on generic text data transfer their knowledge to sentiment analysis tasks in specific domains (e.g., product reviews, movie reviews, social media)?**
- **Can Language Model architectures adapt to sentiment analysis tasks in new domains with minimal fine-tuning or domain-specific data?**
- **Are there any transfer learning techniques which are particularly effective for sentiment analysis?**

### 2. Robustness
- **How robust are Language Model architectures to variations in sentiment expression, such as negations, sarcasm, or context-dependent sentiment?**
